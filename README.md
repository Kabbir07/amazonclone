In this project i just tried how to create new user id and login by existing user.

In "Server" folder(below of macos folder) i wrote the code of backend.
First you need to connet this project with server :
step 1: Right click on server file
step 2: Open in integrated terminal
step 3: in terminal, run -> npm run dev

now server is connected.

Now you can create new account
or
sing in with existing user:

email : user@gmail.com
password : test123
